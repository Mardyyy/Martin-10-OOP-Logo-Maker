# Martin-10-OOP-Logo-Maker
Bootcamp Challenge 10 OOP

## Description
This project is made as a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. This acts a a quick and easy way to generate a logo as a SVG file. This project allowed me to apply what I've learned about Object-oriented Programming from this past week, and learn about SVG files.
